Read, try and get in touch when you're done solving the problem.
It is important that you keep a work diary and send a description of the solution to all three problems in English, ideally by Friday so that we can possibly schedule a technical interview on Friday afternoon.
We are at your disposal for any questions.

//Start//

test.war is a classic JavaEE application running on Tomcat (or another web / application server)


0. The first part of the problem is of course how to run the application. Everything is said in the previous sentence.
- You need tomcat and knowledge of how to run an application on it.
- An additional condition is that it all runs on a Linux virtual machine (eg Ubuntu server or some other console only distro, it doesn't matter which one)
- the port to which Tomcat must respond is 8081

Once the application is launched you encounter the following problems that need to be solved:

1. problem
by mistake the link designer Metadata Administration did not get a bright red background
- propose a solution

2. problem
login screen at the Metadata Administration link. Login is currently down
- why? Given the current code, give at least one hypothesis as to why and how this could have happened
- What is the solution to the problem?


3. problem
you solved it before, but now you get a new and different mistake again
- why is it created?
- What is the "Quick and dirty and immediate" solution to the problem so that the client can continue with his work?
- give a proposal for a permanent solution to the problem
- describe the error and the necessary steps to solve it


NOTES - All available tools available online can be used in troubleshooting. No form of "friend help" is allowed.
If the slightest suspicion arises during the explanation of the solution of the problem that the solution was not reached independently, further conversation will be terminated immediately.
